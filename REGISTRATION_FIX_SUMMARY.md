# ðŸ”§ Registration Fix Summary

## The Issue
User registration data is not showing in the database because:
- The `users` table has a `password_hash` column marked as NOT NULL
- Supabase authentication stores passwords in `auth.users`, not our custom table
- Our registration code tries to insert into `users` table but fails due to missing `password_hash`

## ðŸ“‹ Required Action
**You must run SQL commands in your Supabase dashboard to fix the schema.**

### Quick Fix Steps:
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** â†’ Your Project â†’ SQL Editor
2. **Copy and run the SQL** from `DATABASE_FIX_REQUIRED.md`
3. **Test the fix** by running: `node scripts/test-schema-fix.js`
4. **Try registration** on your website

## ðŸŽ¯ What the Fix Does:
- âœ… Removes problematic `password_hash` requirement
- âœ… Creates automatic trigger for user profile creation
- âœ… Sets up admin account (admin1@gmail.com) automatically  
- âœ… Enables proper security policies
- âœ… Makes all tables use UUID properly

## ðŸ§ª After the Fix:
1. **Registration will work** - users automatically created in both auth and profile tables
2. **Admin account ready** - register with admin1@gmail.com / #Tejith13
3. **Featured products display** - already working with drone data
4. **Authentication UI** - login/signup buttons for guests, profile for users

## ðŸš€ Files Modified:
- `contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Removed manual user insertion (trigger handles it)
- `DATABASE_FIX_REQUIRED.md` - Complete SQL fix commands
- `scripts/test-schema-fix.js` - Test script to verify fix

## âš¡ Quick Test:
After running the SQL fix:
```bash
node scripts/test-schema-fix.js
```

Should show:
- âœ… Manual insert works!
- âœ… Found X users
- âœ… Found X featured products

Then test registration at: http://localhost:3000
