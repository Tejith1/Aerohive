   - Save

2. **Add Redirect URL**:
   - Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Add: `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`
   - Save

3. **Test the Flow**:
   - Register with a real email
   - Check inbox for confirmation email

**📖 See `EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions!**

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] 2. Redirect URL added to Supabase
- [ ] 3. Dev server running (http://localhost:3001)
- [ ] 4. Register with real email address
- [ ] 5. See success toast on registration

## 🎯 How It Works

### Database States:

**After Registration (Before Confirmation):**
```
auth.users:
  - email_confirmed_at: NULL
  - confirmed_at: NULL

public.users:
  - is_active: false  ← Can't log in yet
```

**After Email Confirmation:**
```
auth.users:
  - email_confirmed_at: 2025-10-22 10:30:00
  - confirmed_at: 2025-10-22 10:30:00

public.users:
  - is_active: true  ← Can now log in!
```

### Authentication Flow:

1. **Registration**: `supabase.auth.signUp()` creates user
2. **Email Sent**: Supabase sends confirmation email
3. **Click Link**: Opens `/auth/callback?code=xxx`
4. **Exchange Code**: `exchangeCodeForSession()` creates session
5. **Activate Profile**: Update `is_active = true`
6. **Redirect**: Homepage with success message

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Password Hashing**: Handled by Supabase Auth  
✅ **One-Time Links**: Confirmation codes can't be reused  
✅ **Link Expiry**: 24-hour timeout  
✅ **Session Security**: httpOnly cookies  
✅ **CSRF Protection**: Built into Supabase  
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Supabase prevents spam  

## 📊 Console Logging

When you register, you'll see in browser console:

```
🔧 Supabase Configuration:
URL: ✅ Set
URL Value: https://ohnnwazrfvgccokgkhjj.supabase.co
Anon Key: ✅ Set
Anon Key Length: 237

🔵 Auth Context: Starting Supabase signUp...

}

⚠️ Email confirmation required - no session created

✅ User profile created (inactive until email confirmed)
```
